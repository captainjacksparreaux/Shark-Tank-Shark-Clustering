# Shark-Tank-Shark-Clustering
Examination of Shark Tank TV show offers and pitches
I examined this data set of info from the Shark Tank TV series. The data was copied from @halletecco on google docs and then added to and check against abc.com's prior episode recaps. The goal was to create a model that would help companies coming on the show know which shark was most likely to offer them a deal, and possibly at what cost. I first used bar charts to plot different variables against industry. From here I manipulated the data set to fit the clustering functions. This involved taking only the varibles I wanted and making them 0 or 1. I then created a dendrogram that seemed to show 4 groups would be best, but I tried 6 first, for the 6 sharks. This led to fairly meaningful looking clusters, but when I tried 4 they seemed to be even more distinct.
